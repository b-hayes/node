# NODE

Just documenting my brief refresh with NodeJS, so I can refer to it later.

Using Node v20.

Run `node filename` on each file and read the code.

Below are some more generic notes not related to code.

## Starting a project.
If starting a new project use `npm init -y` to skip all the questions and just create a package.json file.

You might want to edit the file afterwards as the default licence is ISC,
it really should be "UNLICENSED" by default.

## Starting a local web server.
Node already comes with http api.
You don't actually need to install a framework and a million modules to do this.
Run `node 04_http_server.js` for an example.
