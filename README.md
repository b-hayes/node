# NODE

Just documenting my brief refresh with NodeJS, so I can refer to it later.

Using Node v20.

Run `node filename` on each file and read the code.

## General notes.
If starting a new project use `npm init -y` 
to skip all the questions and just create a package.json file.

Its smart and it will look at files in you document for sensible defaults including extracting,
a description from your redme.md file etc.

You might want to edit the file afterwards as the default licence is ISC,
it really should be "UNLICENSED" by default.
